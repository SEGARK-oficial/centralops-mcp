"""Read-only MCP tools for the routing surface (ADR-0008).

Answers triage questions like "why did this event end up in the unrouted DLQ?"
and "which destination should have received it?".

Backend source of truth: backend/app/routers/routes.py
(APIRouter prefix="/collectors/routes", mounted under /api in main.py).
All endpoints below require an admin token (require_admin_user) and are
org-scoped: an org-scoped admin only sees their organization's routes plus
global (shared, organization_id=null) rows.

Only GET endpoints are exposed — no create/update/delete/reorder/rollback/dry-run.
