"""Pipeline-health tools — first stop of a triage session.

Backend source of truth: ``backend/app/routers/pipeline_health.py``
(APIRouter prefix ``/integrations``, mounted under ``/api`` in main.py):

- ``GET /api/integrations/pipeline-health``                     (bulk)
- ``GET /api/integrations/{integration_id}/pipeline-health``    (single)

Both endpoints require ``Permission.INTEGRATION_READ`` (not admin-only) and
are org-scoped: admins see every integration, non-admin tokens only see
integrations of their own organization subtree. Results are served from a
60-second Redis cache; no live vendor calls are made.
